# B35T
Python library for interfacing with Owon B35T multimeter (Windows, BT2.0)


This library relies on the fact that Windows maps the DMM as a COM port when connected. It **won't work on linux** since it doesn't map the meter the same way.

I tested it with **Bluetooth 2.0** version of the DMM only because I don't own the BLE4.0 one.
